There are two scripts in this repository:

tfidfmatrix.py
model.R

First, run tfidfmatrix.py to process the review data and create the tf-idf matrix. 
Then, run model.R for additional processing, model estimation, and generation of the submission file. 
The submission file contains my best results for the Keeping it Fresh competition. 

Data was obtained through registering for the Keeping it Fresh competition: http://www.drivendata.org/competitions/5/
The python script was developed by DrivenData, and is explained in this blogspot: http://blog.drivendata.org/2015/05/07/keeping-it-fresh-benchmark/
